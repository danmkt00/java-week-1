# 📚 Java Projects – Week 1

Now that you’ve learned the **fundamentals of Java** — from setup and writing your first program to variables,
operators, control structures, loops, and console input/output — it’s time to put your knowledge into practice
with some **mini projects**.  

These projects are designed to be **simple, fun, and educational**. They’ll help you apply what you’ve learned
and prepare you for building bigger applications later.

## 📝 Project Ideas

### 1. 📏 Simple Calculator
**Concepts used:** Variables, operators, input/output.  
- Ask the user to enter two numbers.  
- Ask for an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).  
- Use an **if-else** or **switch** to perform the correct calculation.  
- Print the result.

### 2. 🔢 Number Guessing Game
**Concepts used:** Variables, conditionals, loops, input.  
- Generate a random number between 1 and 100.  
- Ask the user to guess the number.  
- Tell them if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.  
- Keep looping until they guess correctly.

### 3. 📅 Day of the Week Finder
**Concepts used:** Switch statement, input/output.  
- Ask the user to enter a number (1–7).  
- Use a **switch** to print the day of the week (1 = Monday, … 7 = Sunday).  
- Handle invalid input gracefully.

### 4. 🧮 Multiplication Table Generator
**Concepts used:** Loops, input/output.  
- Ask the user for a number.  
- Print its multiplication table (1–10) using a **for loop**.  
- Example for input `5`:  
```

5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
...
5 x 10 = 50

### 5. 🎓 Student Grade Calculator
**Concepts used:** Arrays, loops, input/output, conditionals.  
- Ask the user for the number of subjects.  
- Read marks for each subject into an array.  
- Calculate the total and average.  
- Use **if-else** to assign a grade:  
- `A` for average ≥ 80  
- `B` for 60–79  
- `C` for 40–59  
- `F` for below 40

### 6. 🔁 Palindrome Checker
**Concepts used:** Strings, loops, conditionals.  
- Ask the user to enter a word.  
- Check if it reads the same forward and backward.  
- Print whether it’s a palindrome.
